    <div class="accordionDrop">
      <p>This course engages us in peer-to-peer reflection, dialogue, and debate in order to further
develop an understanding of the diversity and scope of design practices. It also provides a more open
structure for us to inquire about and investigate topics not included in their regular coursework.<br><br>

This course is structured to provide weekly organized discussion and reflection of student-attended
events during the course of the semester. This will help us develop a critical lens by which to
evaluate our own creative agency within a broader context.<br><br>

We attend a set number of defined design-related events over the course of the semester,
including lectures, gallery openings, readings, screenings, and performances, at VCU and in the
broader Richmond community. Course readings are assigned to coincide with events that students are
scheduled to attend to prepare students to frame their engagement.<br><br>

This course will serve to introduce and reinforce us to the wealth of cultural events occurring
both on and off campus. The course will also help generate a listing of top cultural events
on and off campus for the current and following semesters to raise awareness for the benefit of peers.</p>

            <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
            <div class="left">
              The departmental faculty have drafted a revised attendance policy, carefully considering the challenges and realities of holding classes in different spaces and in fractured time frames.<br><br>
              The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week. Our department has adopted a revised policy that addresses larger issues of expected engagement in a course. Consistent engagement is a vital component of successful completion of course objectives. The progression of this course requires all participants to be present and actively engaged in class, both during synchronous on-screen meetings, in person, and with asynchronous activities. Consistency of engagement is vital for successful completion of the course objectives. Each of us carries different circumstances and capacities; we are accountable for our own agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now. We are a community.<br><br>

              Be present for this class; participate consistently in the regular give-and-take of the classroom environment; be willing to share thoughts and experiences, as well as willing to actively listen to the thoughts and experiences of others.<br><br>

              Asynchronous engagement is equally important for your success in this course. If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, communicate this clearly with me in a timely manner. Think about the manners in which you feel you will be able to be fully present and active with your community—this may differ from how others respond.<br><br>

This class operates on the principle of charity, respect, and good faith. The responsibility to uphold and bolster these principles falls equally on all members of the class. Active listening is as important as active participation, please be gracious and generous with both. Connecting with peers is encouraged but does not substitute for communicating with the instructor directly. Contact me as soon as possible prior to, or after you miss a class. It is your responsibility to make-up for missing work.

          <p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>

          <div class="left">You will receive ongoing feedback on your work in group critiques and individual critiques with me. Projects and performance in this course will be evaluated with respect to three primary dimensions:<br><br>

⨁ <u>Participation:</u> your overall conduct throughout the duration of the project as you engage with the project and with your peers. Attendance, meeting deadlines, and being prepared for class will also be accounted for.<br>

⨁ <u>Process:</u> strength of your personal methodology and practice; idea generation and exploration; self evaluation; overall rigor in your approach to the project; articulation and presentation of your work; criticality.<br>

⨁ <u>Execution:</u> the quality of your ideas; craft; clarity of organization and presentation, how your materials (paper choice, imagery, typography, etc) connect to your concept.
